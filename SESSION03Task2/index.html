      Tanjiro Kamado is a fictional character and the protagonist of Koyoharu
      Gotouge's manga Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. Tanjiro goes on a quest to
      restore the humanity of his sister, Nezuko, who was turned into a demon
      after his family was killed by Muzan Kibutsuji following an attack that
      resulted in the death of his other relatives. After an encounter with Giyu
      Tomioka, a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyu to also become a
      demon slayer to help his sister turn human again and avenge his family.
      Besides Ufotable's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba anime adaptation,
      Tanjiro has also appeared in a light novel that acts as a prequel to the
      manga.

      The protagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Tanjiro Kamado is the
      oldest son of a late charcoal-seller, Tanjuro. In the first chapter of the
      manga, his family (his mother and his younger siblings) is massacred by a
      demon named Muzan Kibutsuji, with only his sister Nezuko Kamado surviving
      only to become a demon. After seeing Tanjiro's skills in battle as well as
      Nezuko's unwillingness to devour her brother, Giyu Tomioka sends the
      siblings to Sakonji Urokodaki on Mt. Sagiri in order to become a demon
      slayer.
